In those moments, I catch myself talking to you, as if you were right beside me. It’s a whimsical escape from the solitude, a way to weave a touch of companionship into the fabric of my everyday life.

Just the other day, as the water cascaded in the shower, the thought crossed my mind - what if you were here, and I, in my absent-mindedness, had forgotten the towel? With a chuckle, I playfully called out, ‘Palak, could you pass me the towel?’ The mental image of your amused response brought a smile to my face.

Similarly, I find myself sharing thoughts about our potential dinner plans, suggesting a spontaneous movie outing, or even indulging in a whimsical ‘Come, Palak, give me a kiss.’ These moments, though imaginary, serve as a delightful respite from the solitude, infusing my days with a sense of shared joy.

Yet, amidst the playfulness, there’s a genuine longing. I miss you deeply, and I can’t help but wish for a reality where we share these moments for real. The idea of ‘us’ feels like a balm for the solitude, and I yearn for a time when it’s not just my imagination, but our shared reality.

With love hugs and other things,

Pritam
