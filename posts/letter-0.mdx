Back in our school days, your birthday always coincided with the dreaded annual exams. If there was an exam on the day, I‚Äôd wish you in person at school. If not, I‚Äôd ring you up. On that landline. And guess who always answered? Yep, your mom! Always. You never picked up the phone. Classic move on my part was to hang up every time. Sorry about that. I was genuinely scared‚Ä¶

Then came the era of cellphones. I still had your number when you moved to Silchar after high school and would text you on your birthday. But once you moved to Pune, we lost touch.

I would miss you, especially on this day. Sometimes, I would ping you on Facebook and you would respond, although mostly monosyllabic. It took me quite a while to understand that sometimes, you might love someone who isn‚Äôt meant to stay in your life and it‚Äôs alright. You can wish them happiness from afar.

But come to think of it now, you‚Äôve actually been one of those rare constants in my life, in some way or the other. Probably, the only constant‚Ä¶

And I can‚Äôt tell you how much it means to me that today, we can talk normally and I can share anything with you, without the fear of pissing you off.

Birthdays, like today, are the perfect time to reflect on the awesome people we have around us.

I hope you have an amazing birthday and a great year ahead. And whatever demon is bothering you, I am sure you will conquer them someday and wear your scars like wings.

Here‚Äôs to you! You are magic‚ú® Happy birthday! ü•≥ ‚ù§Ô∏è

With love hugs and other things,

Pritam
